==BUILD INFORMATION
Build info for Apache Maven is in pom.xml.
http://maven.apache.org/


==DEPENDENCIES
This code requires:

 * Apache Tomcat ??? also, any specific version
 * Apache Maven 2.0
 * Java SDK 1.6 (Sun Microsystems version, not the OpenJDK VM)
   ???shouldn't that be Oracle now, and doesn't it have a new name/version???
   
 * Google Web Toolkit (GWT) 2.1.1 ???
 * GXT 2.2.1 ???


To install TNRS, do the following in this order:

=======================
1. Install dependencies
=======================

	****************************************************************
	* Install Apache Maven 2.0 from:
	  http://maven.apache.org/
	  
	  The pom.xml file is made to work with 2.0 and has not been 
	  tested on any other version. It may work with later versions,
	  but we offer no guarantees. Please let us know if you are
	  successful using a later version.
	
	****************************************************************
	* Install JavaSDK 1.6 from:
	  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
	  
	  or from your Linux distribution's software repository.
	  
	  Use the Oracle version as the OpenJDK VM has caused problems.
	
	****************************************************************
	* Note:
	  Google Web Toolkit (GWT) 2.1.1 and GXT 2.2.1 will be downloaded
	  and installed automatically by Maven when the software is built.
	
==================
2. Create Database
==================

    ****************************************************************
	Files in the tnrs_db_scripts directory and subdirectories build 
	the TNRS core database and table for the taxamatch application.
	
	Each directory contains one master script (extension php) which 
	calls all the others.
	
	Global parameters are set in the single global_params.inc, in this 
	directory. Also see local params.inc file in each subdirectory.
	
	For a complete build of the database, scripts should be run in the
	following order:
	
	1.	create_tnrs_core.php (in create_tnrs_core/)
	2.	import.php (in import/) - this version loads custom names dump
	from the Tropicos API
	3.	load_staging.php (in load_staging/)
	4.	load_core_db.php (in load_core_db/)
	5.	taxamatch_tables.php (in taxamatch_tables/)
	
	Custom MySQL function strSplit() is required. Use contents of file
	strSplit.txt to add this function to your MySQL installation.
	
	In the tnrs_db_scripts/import directory we have included a small 
	example file called tropicos_api_pinaceae_example.txt. It can be 
	used to do a complete example build of the database, as outlined 
	here.

=======================
3. Install biodiversity
=======================

	****************************************************************
	To install the name parser from GNI, called biodiversity,
	see: /biodiversity/README.rdoc 

====================
3. Install Taxamatch
====================

	****************************************************************
	To install Taxamatch, see: /taxamatch/INSTALL

============================
4. Install TNRS web services
============================

    ****************************************************************
	To install the TNRS web services:
	
	The services use port 14444 by default. Open this port in 
	your firewall, or whatever alternate port you configure the 
	services to use.
	
	Check that the configuration file at
	/services-tnrs/src/main/resources/tnrs_standalone.properties 
	has the correct URL for your installation of Taxamatch. This gets
	packaged in the jar file, so it needs to be modified before 
	compilation.
	
	Enter the /services-tnrs directory from the command line and enter the following commands in this order:
	
	$ mvn clean compile install
	$ mvn dependency:copy-dependencies
	$ cp target/dependencies/* target
	   (The target directory is created during compiling in step one.)
	$ mkdir tnrs-services
	$ mv target/*jar tnrs-services
	
	Copy the start.sh script contained in the source (where, precisely???)
	to tnrs-standalone
	
	We recommend moving the tnrs-standalone directory to /opt for
	consistency with Tomcat general practice and consistency with 
	the TNRS batch processing server.
	
	The application does not currently have a SysV init script, but
	one will be provided soon.
	
=======================================
5. Install TNRS batch processing server
=======================================

    ****************************************************************
	To install the TNRS batch processing server:
	
	The application uses port 14445 by default. Open this port in 
	your firewall, or whatever alternate port you configure the app
	to use.
	
	Enter the /tnrs-batch-server directory from the command line and 
	enter the following commands in this order:
	
	$ mvn clean compile install
	$ mvn dependency:copy-dependencies
	$ cp target/dependencies* /target
	   (The target directory is created during compiling in step one.)
	$ mkdir tnrs-batch
	$ cp target/*.jar tnrs-batch
	
	We recommend moving the tnrs-batch directory to /opt for
	consistency with Tomcat and the TNRS web services.
	
	A startup script called start.sh is provided with the source code 
	(where ???) for managing the server.


===============================
6. Install TNRS web application
===============================

    ****************************************************************
	To install the TNRS web application:
	
	Check that the configuration file at
	/services-tnrs/src/main/resources/tnrs_standalone.properties 
	has the current URLs for the just-installed web services. If they
	are installed on the same machine as this web application and use
	the default ports, use:
	http://localhost:14444/ for services and
	http://localhost:14445/ for the batch server.
	
	Enter the /tnrs-standalone directory from the command line and 
	enter the following commands in this order:
	
	$ mvn clean compile install
	
	This will create a tnrs-standalone.war file. Move this file to the
	webapps directory of your Tomcat installation and restart the
	container to be sure the application is loaded.
